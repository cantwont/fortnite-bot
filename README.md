This project is a simple Fortnite bot written in Node.js that allows you to interact with the Fortnite API and perform actions in the game using commands.

**Emotes:** Use any emote in the game

**Level and Crown Wins:** Adjust your in-game level and crown wins to anything. 


- Level max: 2,147,483,647

**Party Commands:** Kick members and ready up. More to come!

## Authentication

Get your authentication code from this website here: https://www.epicgames.com/id/api/redirect?clientId=3446cd72694c4a4485d81b77adbb2141&responseType=code
This is an official Epic Games website and all it does is give you the code you need to use this bot.
I recommend you use this on a brand new Fortnite account as this might be bannable (not entirely sure) and I am not responsible for any actions done to your account.
